While I, in some limited way, understand the appeal of the conversation around humans being replaced by robots, I do wonder if it is a useful discussion when discussing practices where human and robot existence and operation is not mutually exclusive. In the area of specific kinds physical labour, for example, the conversation is quite relevant as there can reach a point where robotics and human employment are mutually exclusive by virtue of cost benefits for employer and other related factors. However, in the area of live theatre/performance, I do not see, at least in the foreseeable future, human beings being completely replaced by robots. I think this since, by logical thought and looking at history, there exists an unquenchable fascination of the human form in performance. Thinking about all the things that have threatened human performance including the invention of animation, animal performance etc. there always exists an in-demand genre that has humans in it. Based on this logic, I do not see why the question is even how humans will be “replaced” by robots in performance. Rather, I see value in thinking about it in terms of the impacts of the new genre of performance that uses machines/robots that has very limited ties with the existence of humans as performers.
