As I read the pages of this chapter, I paid close attention to my emotional reaction to the depiction of robots as having replicated human emotions. It brought a sense of ease while simultaneously instilling some caution in me. Being victim of the media’s harsh portrayal of robots as death machines the eventually turn on us, thinking of them as being closer to humans, as opposed to some other entity that I do not understand/am not familiar with, makes me feel a sense of ease about the development of robotics. It makes me feel as though I can trust them because, in a way, I think I know their intentions and potential actions similar to how I think I know this about other human by virtue of knowing that I feel the same as them. The caution comes when I think about what it is we still don’t understand about human emotion, particularly human emotions that are held within a “bad” person. Knowing that we do not fully understand human emotion, how can we be sure that by replicating what we see, we are not also replicating the same aspects of emotions that are possessed by someone who is more likely to commit crime, be violent, or generally, just be a bad person?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58554818/189542987-26c79f9f-7f36-493a-9a07-7c52f27a4725.png)
