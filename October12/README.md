Beacuse we had already encorporated using remote control on our robot from our last assignment, this assignment was quite straight forward. We quickly decided on the speech being from one of the Jigsaw movies because of the halloween theme of our robot. We decided to film the video in low lighting as we felt it would lend itself to the creepy feeling we were trying to create with this speech. After recordning the robot spinning in circles, a motion we felt suited the script best, we added Oliver's vocals reading the speech and some other sound effects to set a creepy tone.
