Beacuse we had already encorporated using remote control on our robot from our last assignment, this assignment was quite straight forward. We quickly decided on the speech being from one of the Jigsaw movies because of the halloween theme of our robot. We decided to film the video in low lighting as we felt it would lend itself to the creepy feeling we were trying to create with this speech. After recordning the robot spinning in circles, a motion we felt suited the script best, we added Oliver's vocals reading the speech and some other sound effects to set a creepy tone.

## Response to reading

The reading posits that human beings' fascination with robots stems from our general fascination with our ontological "other." Reading this made me think of where else this fascination might take us in creation, generally. What lengths will we go to to understand ourselves through our creations? Also, does this facination reach into other fields of creation/constuction as well? I see this in the area of creative writing that I am close to. This line of thought makes me see this fascination in all other fields I can think of. What then would it mean to build outside onthology?
