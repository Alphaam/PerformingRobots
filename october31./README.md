Reading this made me think of how I have not been considering UI at all when having conversations about robotics this semester. My conversations have been centred around the emotional impact of robots based on their looks and functions. Thinking about the UI makes me wonder how much of a tool UI in robotics is/can be in reshaping the narratives around robotics. Could extremely impressive and innovative UI in robotics be the key to knocking many negative stereotypes about robotics out of circulation?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58554818/198902628-f2c25215-f6c7-4eca-babc-a1b801eef813.png)
