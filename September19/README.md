As I did this reading, I began thinking more and more about our obsession with what robots don’t do instead of what they are doing right in front of us. A lot of the fear around robotics that is born from the media is about the potential a robot has. The potential to turn into a decepticon, the potential to become fully autonomous and colonize the world, the potential to be violent. In the broader conversation about robotics perception and how to improve it, I wonder if there is a way to address the perception of the potential of a robot. I think working to fix the image of a robot as it immediately presents to humans while also addressing the robot’s fear potential could be a significant way forward towards a more robot-friendly world.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58554818/190929868-e5e1dae5-b9cd-4fcf-ae44-825167ba1690.png)
