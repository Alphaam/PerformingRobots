As I read this reading, I understood instantly that machines definitely have changed the way I live but I remained curious about whether I am, in some way, am immitating my machines. Upon a little reflection, I found that I do, in some ways, imitate my machines. I see this most notably in the social expectations I place upon myself that are similar to the expectations put on machines. The social expectations I have of myself include limitless accessibility of myself and my time by those I care about. This can be paralleled to the expectations placed on technology we use everyday to remain accessible and usable whenever one wants. While one can argue that this expectation of availability is simply a natural part of humanâ€™s nature, I cannot look past the influence that technology has had on this quality by virtue of it providing a means of being constantly available and accessible by, practically, anyone. In this way, I do think we mimic our machines.
